      conn = sqlite3.connect(db_name)
      cursor = conn.cursor()
      cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS patients
                        (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, age INTEGER, diagnosis TEXT)''')
      cursor.execute("INSERT INTO patients (name, age, diagnosis) VALUES (?, ?, ?)",
                     (patient_data['name'], patient_data['age'], patient_data['diagnosis']))
      conn.commit()
