1. **HTML Structure:**
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>To-Do List</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>To-Do List</h1>
        <form id="todo-form">
            <input type="text" id="todo-input" placeholder="Add a new task" required>
            <button type="submit">Add</button>
        </form>
        <ul id="todo-list"></ul>

        <script src="app.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

2. **JavaScript Functionality:**
    ```javascript
    // app.js
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
        const form = document.getElementById('todo-form');
        const input = document.getElementById('todo-input');
        const todoList = document.getElementById('todo-list');

        form.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
            e.preventDefault();
            const task = input.value.trim();
            if (task) {
                addTask(task);
                input.value = '';
            }
        });

        function addTask(task) {
            const li = document.createElement('li');
            li.textContent = task;
            todoList.appendChild(li);
        }
    });
    ```

**Explanation:**

- The HTML structure includes a form with an input field for adding tasks and an unordered list to display the tasks.
- The JavaScript code adds event listeners to handle form submissions and dynamically update the to-do list.
- When a task is added, a new list item (`<li>`) is created and appended to the to-do list.

##### Weather App with API Integration

This project demonstrates how to use GitHub Copilot to create a simple weather application that fetches data from a weather API and displays it.

**HTML Structure:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Weather App</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Weather App</h1>
    <form id="weather-form">
        <input type="text" id="city-input" placeholder="Enter city name" required>
        <button type="submit">Get Weather</button>
    </form>
    <div id="weather-result"></div>

    <script src="weather.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

**JavaScript Functionality:**
```javascript
// weather.js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const form = document.getElementById('weather-form');
    const input = document.getElementById('city-input');
    const weatherResult = document.getElementById('weather-result');

    form.addEventListener('submit', async (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        const city = input.value.trim();
        if (city) {
            const weather = await getWeather(city);
            displayWeather(weather);
            input.value = '';
        }
    });

    async function getWeather(city) {
        const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
        const response = await fetch(`https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=${apiKey}&units=metric`);
        const data = await response.json();
        return data;
    }

    function displayWeather(weather) {
        if (weather.cod === 200) {
            weatherResult.innerHTML = `
                <h2>${weather.name}</h2>
                <p>Temperature: ${weather.main.temp} °C</p>
                <p>Weather: ${weather.weather[0].description}</p>
            `;
        } else {
            weatherResult.innerHTML = `<p>${weather.message}</p>`;
        }
    }
});
```

**Explanation:**

- The HTML includes a form for entering a city name and a div to display the weather results.
- The JavaScript code fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on the entered city name.
- When the form is submitted, it triggers an API call to fetch the weather data and displays it in the weather result div.

#### Source Code with Explanations

##### Data Analysis Script in Python

This example demonstrates how to use GitHub Copilot to write a data analysis script that loads, cleans, and analyzes a dataset.

**Python Code:**
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load data from a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Clean and preprocess data
data.dropna(inplace=True)  # Remove missing values
data['age'] = data['age'].astype(int)  # Convert age column to integers

# Analyze data
average_age = data['age'].mean()
max_age = data['age'].max()
min_age = data['age'].min()

  function loadData(data) {
      // ...
  }

  function cleanData(data) {
      // ...
  }

  function analyzeData(data) {
      // ...
  }

  function processData(data) {
      let loadedData = loadData(data);
      let cleanedData = cleanData(loadedData);
      return analyzeData(cleanedData);
  }
  ```

##### Include Comments and Documentation

- Add comments to explain complex logic and document functions with docstrings. This makes your code easier to understand and maintain.

  public class Config {
      public static final String API_URL = "https://api.example.com";
  }

  // Good
  public class Config {
      public static final String API_URL = System.getenv("API_URL");
  }
  ```

##### Write Unit Tests

- Write unit tests for your functions and methods to ensure they work correctly. Use testing frameworks such as `unittest` in Python, `JUnit` in Java, or `Jest` in JavaScript.
- **Example:**
  ```python
  import unittest

  def calculate_sum(a, b):
      return a + b

  class TestCalculateSum(unittest.TestCase):
      def test_calculate_sum(self):
          self.assertEqual(calculate_sum(1, 2), 3)
          self.assertEqual(calculate_sum(-1, 1), 0)
