1. **HTML Structure:**
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>To-Do List</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>To-Do List</h1>
        <form id="todo-form">
            <input type="text" id="todo-input" placeholder="Add a new task" required>
            <button type="submit">Add</button>
        </form>
        <ul id="todo-list"></ul>

        <script src="app.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

2. **JavaScript Functionality:**
    ```javascript
    // app.js
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
        const form = document.getElementById('todo-form');
        const input = document.getElementById('todo-input');
        const todoList = document.getElementById('todo-list');

        form.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
            e.preventDefault();
            const task = input.value.trim();
            if (task) {
                addTask(task);
                input.value = '';
            }
        });

        function addTask(task) {
            const li = document.createElement('li');
            li.textContent = task;
            todoList.appendChild(li);
        }
    });
    ```

**Explanation:**

- The HTML structure includes a form with an input field for adding tasks and an unordered list to display the tasks.
- The JavaScript code adds event listeners to handle form submissions and dynamically update the to-do list.
- When a task is added, a new list item (`<li>`) is created and appended to the to-do list.

##### Weather App with API Integration

This project demonstrates how to use GitHub Copilot to create a simple weather application that fetches data from a weather API and displays it.

**HTML Structure:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Weather App</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Weather App</h1>
    <form id="weather-form">
        <input type="text" id="city-input" placeholder="Enter city name" required>
        <button type="submit">Get Weather</button>
    </form>
    <div id="weather-result"></div>

    <script src="weather.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

**JavaScript Functionality:**
```javascript
// weather.js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const form = document.getElementById('weather-form');
    const input = document.getElementById('city-input');
    const weatherResult = document.getElementById('weather-result');

    form.addEventListener('submit', async (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        const city = input.value.trim();
        if (city) {
            const weather = await getWeather(city);
            displayWeather(weather);
            input.value = '';
        }
    });

    async function getWeather(city) {
        const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
        const response = await fetch(`https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=${apiKey}&units=metric`);
        const data = await response.json();
        return data;
    }

    function displayWeather(weather) {
        if (weather.cod === 200) {
            weatherResult.innerHTML = `
                <h2>${weather.name}</h2>
                <p>Temperature: ${weather.main.temp} °C</p>
                <p>Weather: ${weather.weather[0].description}</p>
            `;
        } else {
            weatherResult.innerHTML = `<p>${weather.message}</p>`;
        }
    }
});
```

**Explanation:**

- The HTML includes a form for entering a city name and a div to display the weather results.
- The JavaScript code fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on the entered city name.
- When the form is submitted, it triggers an API call to fetch the weather data and displays it in the weather result div.

#### Source Code with Explanations

##### Data Analysis Script in Python

This example demonstrates how to use GitHub Copilot to write a data analysis script that loads, cleans, and analyzes a dataset.

**Python Code:**
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load data from a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Clean and preprocess data
data.dropna(inplace=True)  # Remove missing values
data['age'] = data['age'].astype(int)  # Convert age column to integers

# Analyze data
average_age = data['age'].mean()
max_age = data['age'].max()
min_age = data['age'].min()

print(f'Average age: {average_age}')
print(f'Max age: {max_age}')
print(f'Min age: {min_age}')
```

**Explanation:**

- The script uses pandas to load data from a CSV file.
- It cleans the data by removing rows with missing values and converting the age column to integers.
- The script calculates and prints the average, maximum, and minimum ages in the dataset.

##### Web Scraping with Python

This example shows how to use GitHub Copilot to create a web scraper that extracts data from a website.

**Python Code:**
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape_website(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    titles = soup.find_all('h2')
    for title in titles:
        print(title.text)

# Example usage
scrape_website('https://example.com')
```

**Explanation:**

- The script uses the `requests` library to fetch the HTML content of a webpage.
- It uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract all `<h2>` elements.
- The titles of the extracted elements are printed to the console.

  - **Imports:** Import each module on a separate line. Group imports in the following order: standard library, third-party libraries, and local application imports.
  - **Whitespace:** Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside parentheses, brackets, or braces.
  - **Naming Conventions:** 
    - Functions and variable names should be written in `snake_case`.
    - Class names should be written in `CamelCase`.
  - **Example:**
    ```python
    import os
    import sys

    def calculate_sum(a, b):
        return a + b

    class MyClass:
        def __init__(self, value):
            self.value = value
    ```

##### JavaScript

- **ESLint - JavaScript Linter:**
  - **Indentation:** Use 2 spaces per indentation level.
  - **Quotes:** Use single quotes (`'`) for strings, except to avoid escaping.
  - **Semicolons:** Use semicolons to terminate statements.
  - **Naming Conventions:**
    - Variables and functions should be written in `camelCase`.
    - Class names should be written in `PascalCase`.
  - **Example:**
    ```javascript
    function calculateSum(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    class MyClass {
        constructor(value) {
            this.value = value;
        }
    }
    ```

##### Java

- **Google Java Style Guide:**
  - **Indentation:** Use 2 spaces per indentation level.
  - **Line Length:** Limit lines to 100 characters.
  - **Braces:** Use braces for all control structures, even single-line blocks.
  - **Naming Conventions:**
    - Variables and methods should be written in `camelCase`.
    - Class names should be written in `CamelCase`.
    - Constants should be written in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
  - **Example:**
    ```java
    public class MyClass {
        private int value;

        public MyClass(int value) {
            this.value = value;
        }

        public int calculateSum(int a, int b) {
            return a + b;
        }
    }
    ```

##### HTML/CSS

- **HTML5 Boilerplate:**
  - **Indentation:** Use 2 spaces per indentation level.
  - **Attributes:** Use double quotes around attribute values.
  - **Naming Conventions:**
    - Use `kebab-case` for CSS class names.
  - **Example:**
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Document</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1 class="main-title">Hello, World!</h1>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

- **CSS:**
  ```css
  .main-title {
      font-size: 2em;
      color: #333;
  }
  ```

#### Best Practices for Writing Clean, Maintainable Code

##### Use Meaningful Variable Names

- Choose descriptive names that convey the purpose of the variable. Avoid single-letter names, except for loop counters.
- **Example:**
  ```python
  # Bad
  x = 10
  y = 20
  z = x + y

  # Good
  width = 10
  height = 20
  area = width + height
  ```

##### Write Modular and Reusable Code

- Break down large functions into smaller, reusable components. Each function should have a single responsibility.
- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  // Bad
  function processData(data) {
      // Load data
      let loadedData = loadData(data);
      // Clean data
      let cleanedData = cleanData(loadedData);
      // Analyze data
      let analysis = analyzeData(cleanedData);
      return analysis;
  }

  // Good
  function loadData(data) {
      // ...
  }

  function cleanData(data) {
      // ...
  }

  function analyzeData(data) {
      // ...
  }

  function processData(data) {
      let loadedData = loadData(data);
      let cleanedData = cleanData(loadedData);
      return analyzeData(cleanedData);
  }
  ```

##### Include Comments and Documentation

- Add comments to explain complex logic and document functions with docstrings. This makes your code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Example:**
  ```python
  def calculate_area(radius):
      """
      Calculate the area of a circle given its radius.

      Parameters:
      radius (float): The radius of the circle

      Returns:
      float: The area of the circle
      """
      import math
      return math.pi * (radius ** 2)
  ```

##### Maintain Consistent Formatting

- Use a code formatter or linter to maintain consistent code formatting across your project.
- **Example:**
  - In Python, use `black` to automatically format your code.
  - In JavaScript, use `prettier` to format your code.

##### Avoid Hardcoding Values

- Use constants, configuration files, or environment variables to manage values that may change or need to be reused.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  // Bad
  public class Config {
      public static final String API_URL = "https://api.example.com";
  }

  // Good
  public class Config {
      public static final String API_URL = System.getenv("API_URL");
  }
  ```

##### Write Unit Tests

- Write unit tests for your functions and methods to ensure they work correctly. Use testing frameworks such as `unittest` in Python, `JUnit` in Java, or `Jest` in JavaScript.
- **Example:**
  ```python
  import unittest

  def calculate_sum(a, b):
      return a + b

  class TestCalculateSum(unittest.TestCase):
      def test_calculate_sum(self):
          self.assertEqual(calculate_sum(1, 2), 3)
          self.assertEqual(calculate_sum(-1, 1), 0)

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      unittest.main()
  ```

By following these coding standards and best practices, you can ensure that your code is clean, maintainable, and of high quality. Consistency in coding style not only makes it easier for others to understand and contribute to your projects but also helps in identifying and fixing issues more efficiently.

- **Recommended Coding Standards:**
  - Follow language-specific style guides, such as PEP 8 for Python or ESLint for JavaScript.

- **Best Practices for Writing Clean, Maintainable Code:**
  - Use meaningful variable names.
